Anthony Martino’s Code Louisville Front-end Web Development Project
January - March 2017

For my project, I decided to showcase a simple image gallery and about page.  I am a photographer and would like to create my own portfolio page for the future.  I felt that having a simple foundation would be the best way to build later on down the road.  I included an about me page with working links to my email and twitter.

However, I have chosen not to add my own photos but rather pictures of hamburgers from wikicommons instead.  Not that I don’t want to share any of my own work, the burgers kept my mind off personal content and focused on structure…and sometimes burgers.

There are no special instructions for this site.  Just run index.html on a browser and everything should work.  Images, css, and js all have their own folders and should be properly linked.  There are two media queries in a dedicated .css file.  This site has three viewing modes: phone, tablet, and desktop.
